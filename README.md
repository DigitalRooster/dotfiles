A dotfiles repo without any dotfiles. - Various configuration files.

Firefox CSS
===========

Firefox theme to compliment tsnsnd's [Visual Style.](http://twnsnd.deviantart.com/art/pix-light-visual-style-300496433)
Uses hdni's excellent [Phosphene](https://github.com/hdni/Phosphene) CSS as a base for the icons. And therefore needs [FX Chrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) to function properly

Firefox CSS (Old)
=================

Firefox theme to compliment Ramvmunken's excellent [visual style.](http://ravmunken.deviantart.com/art/Deshou-VS-394841179)
Based off of [FullFlat](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/full-flat/) (Needed for it to work)

This CSS is now out of date and doesn't display correctly with australis sometimes.
